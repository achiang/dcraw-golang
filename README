This is a little project to learn go by porting dcraw.c.

Each commit should be a self-contained go lesson.

dcraw was obtained from:
	http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/

dcraw is sufficiently complicated that a port isn't straightforward. I am
using some standard profiling tools to help me make sure I don't miss things.
Below are some notes on how to build dcraw.c with profiling.

Building  dcraw
===============
$ gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage -o gcc-dcraw dcraw.c -lm -g -pg -DNODEPS

Flat profile
============
$ ./gcc-dcraw -i IMG_1100.CR2
$ gprof -b -l gcc-dcraw

Line-by-line
============
$ gcov ./gcc-dcraw -i IMG_1100.CR2
$ gcov dcraw.c
